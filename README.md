# Cinemate: A Movie Booking App

Cinemate is a Python-based movie booking application built using the Tkinter library. It simplifies the process of booking and managing movie tickets, providing a user-friendly interface for both customers and administrators. This README file provides an overview of the project and descriptions of the key files used in Cinemate.

## Project Description

Cinemate is designed to streamline the movie booking experience by offering the following features:

- **User-friendly interface**: Cinemate provides an intuitive interface that allows users to browse available movies, select showtimes, and book tickets effortlessly.

- **User registration and authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their booking history.

- **Movie catalog**: The application offers a catalog of available movies, including details such as the movie's title, description, showtimes, and pricing.

- **Booking and payment**: Users can select their preferred showtimes, choose seats, and make _mock_ secure online payments for their tickets.

- **Admin panel**: Administrators have access to an admin panel that allows them to add, edit, or remove movies and showtimes. They can also view and manage user booking records.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `mainTK.py`

This file is the main entry point of the Cinemate application. It is responsible for launching the application and handling user interactions. The `mainTK.py` file creates the graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library and connects the application to the backend logic implemented in `main.py`.

### 2. `Project.py`

The `Project.py` file contains the backend logic for Cinemate. It manages user accounts, movie data, and booking functionality. This file communicates with the GUI created in `mainTK.py` and ensures the application's core functionality.

### 3. `userdata.json`

`userdata.json` is a JSON file that stores user account information, including usernames, passwords, and booking history. User data is loaded and saved from/to this file to maintain user accounts across sessions.

### 4. `browse.json`

`browse.json` is a JSON file used to store information about available movies, showtimes, and pricing. It acts as the database for movie-related data and is used to populate the movie catalog in the application.
